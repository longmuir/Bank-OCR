My Comments: 

This is one of the most interesting Kata's I've completed due to the way that it evolves after each iteration.  It forces you to think carefully about where you put different pieces of logic and the messages you send between different objects.  I know there are different ways I could have done this.  I'd be interested to discuss with others who've completed this kata.
